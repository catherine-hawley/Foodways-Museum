      <h2>About the Museum</h2>
      <p>The Pacific Northwest Foodways Museum explores the rich culinary heritage of the region through time and across
        cultures, from ancient Indigenous food practices to contemporary immigrant foodways. Our mission is to preserve,
        document, and celebrate the diverse food traditions that have shaped the Pacific Northwest, honoring the
        knowledge keepers, cooks, and communities who sustain these vital cultural practices. Through archaeological
        artifacts, ethnographic research, and community partnerships, we tell the stories of how food creates identity,
        builds connections, and sustains both body and culture across generations.</p>
