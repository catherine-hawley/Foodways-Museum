            <p>Dr. Sarah Chen is Head of the Foodways Collection and a food archaeologist specializing in the culinary heritage and subsistence practices of the Pacific Northwest. She holds a Ph.D. in Anthropological Archaeology from the University of British Columbia, with a dissertation focusing on ancient salmon processing techniques among Coast Salish communities, and a B.A. in Archaeology from the University of Washington. Dr. Chen's current projects explore the deep history of camas cultivation, shellfish harvesting traditions, and the social dimensions of potlatch feasting practices throughout the Salish Sea region. In her role at the museum, she oversees the curation and interpretation of archaeological materials related to food production, preparation, and consumption, while developing exhibitions that bring the region's rich culinary heritage to life for diverse audiences.</p>

            <p>Dr. Antonio Ross is Curator of Contemporary Foodways and a culinary anthropologist who bridges the worlds of professional cuisine and academic research at the museum. Before pursuing his Ph.D. in Anthropology with a focus on food studies from the University of Washington, Dr. Ross spent fifteen years as an executive chef in Seattle's restaurant scene. His unique background allows him to examine foodways, particularly the intersections of immigration, identity, and cuisine in urban environments. At the museum, Dr. Ross develops immersive exhibits that incorporate taste, smell, and hands-on cooking demonstrations, and leads community partnership initiatives that bring diverse voices into the institution's programming and collections.</p>

            <p>Dr. Helen Ramos is Senior Researcher and a food ethnographer whose decades-long career has taken her across six continents to document culinary traditions, agricultural practices, and food-based social systems. She holds a Ph.D. in Sociocultural Anthropology from the University of California, Berkeley, with a dissertation on women's food knowledge systems in street markets, and a B.A. in Anthropology and Linguistics from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Dr. Ramos's work examines gender and foodways, intergenerational knowledge transmission, and the impacts of globalization on local food systems. In 2019, she received the prestigious Margaret Mead Award from the American Anthropological Association and the Society for Applied Anthropology for her groundbreaking work linking ethnographic research to food security and cultural preservation initiatives. </p>
