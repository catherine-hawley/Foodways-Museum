            <p>Dr. Sarah Chen is Head of the Foodways Collection and a food archaeologist specializing in the culinary heritage and subsistence practices of the Pacific Northwest. A descendant of Chinese immigrants who settled in the Salish Sea region during the late 19th century, Dr. Chen brings a deeply personal perspective to her research on cross-cultural foodways and the contributions of Asian communities to the Pacific Northwest's culinary landscape. She holds a Ph.D. in Anthropological Archaeology from the University of British Columbia, with a dissertation focusing on ancient salmon processing techniques among Coast Salish communities, and a B.A. in Archaeology from the University of Washington. Dr. Chen's research examines how foodways have evolved across time and social boundaries in the region, with particular expertise in zooarchaeology, paleobotany, and isotopic analysis. In her work, she employs a range of analytical tools including stable isotope mass spectrometry for dietary reconstruction, scanning electron microscopy for identifying tool use-wear patterns, and ground-penetrating radar for locating archaeological features such as earth ovens and food storage pits. She also utilizes GIS mapping to track seasonal resource procurement patterns and collaborates closely with Indigenous communities to integrate traditional ecological knowledge with archaeological evidence. Dr. Chen's current projects explore the deep history of camas cultivation, shellfish harvesting traditions, and the social dimensions of potlatch feasting practices throughout the Salish Sea region. In her role at the museum, she oversees the curation and interpretation of archaeological materials related to food production, preparation, and consumption, while developing exhibitions that bring the region's rich culinary heritage to life for diverse audiences.</p>

            <p>Dr. Antonio Ross is Curator of Contemporary Foodways and a culinary anthropologist who bridges the worlds of professional cuisine and academic research at the museum. Before pursuing his Ph.D. in Anthropology with a focus on food studies from the University of Washington, Dr. Thompson spent fifteen years as an executive chef in Seattle's restaurant scene, including acclaimed positions at waterfront establishments specializing in Pacific Northwest regional cuisine. He holds a B.A. in Cultural Anthropology from Reed College and completed his culinary training at the Culinary Institute of America. His unique background allows him to examine foodways through both practical and theoretical lenses, with particular expertise in ethnographic research methods, oral history collection, and sensory analysis. Dr. Ross's research explores the intersections of immigration, identity, and cuisine in urban environments, with current projects documenting the foodways of Southeast Asian, Pacific Islander, and Latin American communities in the Puget Sound region. He employs participatory research methods including collaborative cooking sessions, and digital ethnography to trace ingredient networks and recipe transmission across generations. At the museum, Dr. Ross develops immersive exhibits that incorporate taste, smell, and hands-on cooking demonstrations, and leads community partnership initiatives that bring diverse voices into the institution's programming and collections. His work emphasizes food justice, culinary sovereignty, and the recognition of professional and home cooks as knowledge keepers in their communities.</p>

            <p>Dr. Helen Ramos is Senior Researcher and a food ethnographer whose decades-long career has taken her across six continents to document culinary traditions, agricultural practices, and food-based social systems. She holds a Ph.D. in Sociocultural Anthropology from the University of California, Berkeley, with a dissertation on women's food knowledge systems in street markets, and a B.A. in Anthropology and Linguistics from the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Born in Mexico City and raised between Mexico and the United States, Dr. Ramos's bicultural upbringing instilled in her a profound appreciation for how food creates and maintains cultural identity across diasporic communities. Having conducted extended ethnographic research in Mexico, Peru, Colombia, India, Morocco, Indonesia, and numerous other nations, she is fluent in Spanish, English, and Portuguese, and conversational in several other languages. Her research methodology combines classical participant observation with innovative approaches including mobile ethnography, digital storytelling, and collaborative filmmaking. Dr. Ramos's work examines gender and foodways, intergenerational knowledge transmission, and the impacts of globalization on local food systems. In 2019, she received the prestigious Margaret Mead Award from the American Anthropological Association and the Society for Applied Anthropology for her groundbreaking work linking ethnographic research to food security and cultural preservation initiatives. At the museum, she oversees international research partnerships and is currently leading the development of a major new permanent exhibit exploring the foodways of immigrant and refugee communities in the Pacific Northwest, tracing how culinary traditions adapt, persist, and transform across generations in the region.</p>
